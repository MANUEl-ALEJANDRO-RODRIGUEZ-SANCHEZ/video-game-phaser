# üöÄ Avoid Obstacles Game

## Project Description

The **Avoid Obstacles Game** is an exciting video game where the player controls a spaceship that follows the mouse pointer. The objective is simple but challenging: avoid collisions with meteorites that generate randomly and move towards the ship from different directions. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases with an increase in the speed of the meteors, testing your reflexes and skills.

This game was designed to be intuitive and easy to play, but difficult to master, offering an addictive experience for players of all ages.

## üéÆ Main Features

- **Intuitive Control:** Use the mouse pointer to move the spaceship. No keys required, just move the mouse and avoid obstacles.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** As time passes, the speed of the meteorites increases, making the game more challenging.
- **Collision Detection:** The game ends if the spaceship collides with a meteorite, displaying a "Game Over" screen with your final score.
- **Game Statistics:** The score is displayed in real time, allowing you to see how far you go with each attempt.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Phaser 3:** This is a 2D game development framework based on JavaScript. Phaser makes it easy to create interactive and visually appealing games. It was used to handle game physics, collision detection, sprite movement, and meteor generation.
  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** JavaScript was used to control the game logic, including creating obstacles, handling events, and manipulating the DOM to display the "Game Over" screen.

- **HTML5:** The game is integrated into a simple HTML5 page, which acts as a container for the canvas where the game is rendered.

- **CSS3:** CSS was used to stylize the "Game Over" screen, ensuring the final message is clear and focused, providing a pleasant user experience.

## üí° How to Play

1. **Move the Ship:** Simply move the mouse pointer to control the spaceship.
2. **Avoid Obstacles:** Stay away from meteors heading towards you.
3. **Score:** Your score increases as you survive. Try to reach the highest score possible!
4. **Restart the Game:** If you collide with a meteorite, click the "Restart" button on the "Game Over" screen to try again.

## üåü Inspiration and Objective

This project was created with the purpose of learning and applying fundamental concepts in video game development using **Phaser 3**. It focuses on event management, collision detection, and handling physics within a 2D environment. In addition, we sought to design a simple game, but with an addictive component that motivates players to constantly improve their skills.

## üîç Conclusions

The **Avoid Obstacles Game** is a clear example of how modern technologies like Phaser 3 and JavaScript can be combined to create engaging and dynamic gaming experiences. This project not only shows the power of these tools, but also how game development can be accessible and fun for all programming skill levels.
